<h1>Building a simple wheeled vehicle </h1>
<p> This tutorial is to assist developers in creating a simple wheeled vehicle, 
  with collision information for use in the Torque Game Engine. </p>

<h3 id="start">Getting Started</h3>
<p>Ok, let's begin by building a simple wheeled vehicle.</p>
<p>Our goals for this tutorial are to:
</p><ul>
  <li>Get an understanding of the naming and object hierarchy used by the Exporter 
    for wheeled vehicles. 
  </li><li>Create a wheeled vehicle, including collision information . 
  </li><li>Export it! 
</li></ul>
<h3 id="required">Required objects</h3>
<p>Care must be taken to model your shapes according to the guidelines detailed 
  in the <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/docs/torque.sdk/tools/max2dts/">MAX2DTSExporter 
  Documentation</a> to ensure the exporter recognizes the various components and 
  knows how to export them. </p>

    <td>For the model the naming and hierarchical linkage we need to use is as 
      follows; 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"bounds"</strong> a mesh object at the ROOT of the scene, 
          encompasses the complete model and any animations performed by the model. 
        </li><li><strong>"shape"</strong> a dummy object at the ROOT used by the exporter 
          to identify the model, and it various levels of detail (LOD). 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>"collision-1"</strong> a dummy object, markers 
              for collisions. Collision-1 thru Collision-9 
            </li><li> <strong>"detail#"</strong> a dummy object, at least one must 
              exist, however typically several exist to represent different LOD 
              to be applied against a shape. 
            </li><li><strong>"LOS-#"</strong> a dummy object, markers for 
              "Line Of Sight" collision ("bullet collision") 
              LOS-9 thru LOS-15 
            </li><li><strong>"start"</strong> a dummy object, which identified the 
              start of our model. Any name can be used. 
              <ul>
                <li><strong>"vehiclemesh#"</strong> a mesh object, used to make 
                  up the model. As many mesh object can be used as long a LOD 
                  number is appended to their name. 
                </li><li><strong>"col-1"</strong> a mesh object, this is 
                  the actual collision geometry for the vehicle itself. It should 
                  be as absolutely LOW POLY as possible. Every polygon counts 
                  and will slow the whole game down if you have too many. Also, 
                  pay special attention to the way it is shaped to minimize collision 
                  with small bumps/hills/slopes etc. Changing this shape will 
                  dramatically effect whether or not the vehicle is prone to getting 
                  stuck while driving over bumps 
                </li><li><strong>"LOScol-#"</strong> a mesh object, Geometry 
                  for line of sight collisions . 
                </li><li><strong>"eye" </strong>a dummy object, this is where 
                  the camera will be when piloting a vehicle in 1st-person mode. 
                </li><li><strong>"cam"</strong> a dummy object, this is where 
                  the camera will be when piloting a vehicle in 3rd-person mode. 
                </li><li><strong>"mount#"</strong> a dummy object, these 
                  are where the players\weapons mount. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>mount0 -- driver</li>
                    <li>mount1 -- navigator\gunner</li>
                    <li>mount2-8 -- passenger's</li>
                    <li>mount9 -- bomb mount point on the bomber vehicle</li>
                    <li>mount10 -- gun</li>
                  </ul>
                </li><li><strong>"mass"</strong> a dummy object, this is 
                  used in the driving\flying dynamics. This should be positioned 
                  at the center of mass for the whole shape. 
                </li><li><strong>"hub#"</strong> a dummy object, center point 
                  for wheels. Position these where you want the center of your 
                  wheel to be in its top most position.

<h3 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step building the Vehicle</h3>
<p>In 3DS MAX start a new scene. Follow each of the following steps to create 
  a simple wheeled vehicle.</p>
<p>A few side notes before we begin. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First you want to get your grid to 1.0, so click on Customize &gt; Grids 
    and snaps &gt; Home grid. Select all view points, change Grid spacing to 1. 
    After that you still have to zoom in to get to grid 1, look in the bottom 
    right to tell what your at. </li>
  <li>To know how to scale your model basically 1 is equal to 1 meter in game. 
    So a person is about 2.5 in 3dsmax. I usually make a temporary mesh object 
    to judge how big to make my vehicle.</li>
  <li>The other thing I've learned from working with 3dsmax is when you create 
    these objects below always create them in the Top view. The reason for this 
    is the pivot for each object needs to be correct for most objects like your 
    mesh, mount0, mass, etc or you will get some weird effects. If you create 
    them in top it will always be right. To check what a mesh is set to look at 
    Command Panels -&gt; Hierarchy -&gt; Pivot -&gt; Affect Pivot Point - blue axis points 
    towards the top of the shape, the green axis towards the front of the shape, 
    and the red axis towards the right of the shape.</li>
  <li>When exporting make sure you have Collapse Transforms unchecked in parameters 
    under the DTS Exporter! I spent many hours banging my head on this one. Thanks 
    to Vinci_Smurf for the tip!</li>

        <li>From the "Command Panels -&gt; Utilities" select the "DTS Exporter Utility

        <li>When your ready click "Whole Shape".</li>

<p>Thats pretty much all there is to it. I plan to add examples of doing animations

  <li>Next step is to head on over to the <a href="http://tork.beffy.de/tutorials/vehicles/datablock.htm">datablock example</a>
