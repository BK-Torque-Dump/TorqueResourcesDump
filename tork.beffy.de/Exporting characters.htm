<p>OK These are the steps that I have used to get a complete character shape into the game with my own sequences .
I have had no problems since I have started to follow these steps so I will attempt to put them down for you to
use and maybe they will help you find out what you are missing . I have found that for most of the times that I
had not been able to export a mesh that it was some small oversite that I didnt bother to double check hehehe
routine checking is your best friend : ) </p>

<p>Also , I got all this Info by reading and re reading Joe Marshuks ( My apologies if I spelt Joes last name wrong )
3dsmaxdts exporter docs . They give you the 
full meat and bones of the subject.</p>

<h3>1.)ADDING THE BIPED </h3>

First ,make sure your character is scaled properly { Its on the Docs } ,and centered at 0 ,0 ,0 with its feet just at 0 ,
and that when you are viewing him/her in the front viewport , that you are seeing the characters back . 
<br>
Then reset x-form on your character I use the box method suggested in the docs , create a box and move it to 0,0,0 .
Convert the box to an editable mesh 
{{ you can make a simple max script to automate making the box ,moving it to ,0,0,0,and converting it to an editablemesh
by using this script ---&gt; Box lengthsegs:1 widthsegs:1 heightsegs:1 length:2 width:2 height:2 
transform:(matrix3 [-1,0,0] [0,0,1] [0,1,0] [0,0,0]) isSelected:on 
set coordsys world 
macros.run "Modifier Stack" "Convert_to_Mesh" }} ,
attach the box to your character . Deselect attach , go into sub-object mode and select "element" . Select the box ,
and delete it clicking yes when it asks you to delete isolated vertices . Leave sub-object mode and rename you mesh to
whatever you like ( the box trick changes the name of your mesh to box : ) I use bodymesh for my character mesh names. 
go to your Hierchy tab in the command panle , select "pivot" , Click on "affect pivot only " , and then make sure
the characters pivot is set to have the red arrow facing RIGHT , green FORWARD and blue UP . 
de-activate affect pivot only and your mesh is ready to add the biped .(make sure your mesh is an editable "mesh"
not and editable"poly" if you are using max 4 or you will get an error exporting } 
<br>
Create a biped to fit the character and then got to figure mode { located in the command panel under "motion " when
you have a piece of the biped selected } activate it , select Bip01 and rotate it so it is facing the same way as your mesh .
While still in figure mode , adjust your biped till it is the way you 
want it , then save the FIG file so you have a root back up . De-activate Figure mode , you can also save your biped now too .
I do so I have a back up. 
<br>
Add a skin modifier and add the bones you want to affect your mesh ( I leave out bip01 , and any that end with nub }
Do your weighting till you are satisfied , and make sure you have a weight assigned to all vertices , or you will get
an error when you export. 


<h3>2.)ADDING MULTIRES AND MULTI-RES DETAIL LEVELS</h3>

OK now that your Mesh is ready , we can do a quick recap to make sure its really ready . 

In the front viewport you should be looking at the backs of the mesh and the biped , and your mesh should be scaled
if not well start over 

If so , select the mesh and click on tools--&gt; snapshot make sure its set to single and mesh .
rename it to MultiRes::(NAME OF MESH) 
<p>ie: MultiRes::bodymesh</p>

link MultiRes::bodymesh to your main mesh " bodymesh" 
add a MultiRes Modifier to MultiRes::BodyMesh then , go to your utilities panel ,
select maxscript and then choose open script 

<br>open the <b>adjustLODs.mcr</b> that you get with the torque filepack . you need
to install this script which you do by opening it , and selecting all the text you see in the maxscript
listener except for the top line 

<pre>" macroScript adjustLODs category:"Torque_Tools" tooltip:"Adjust LODs"" </pre>

it creates an error when you do it this way , you then drag it all to your toolbar or a tab panel.
If it works you'll see a button called <b>adjustLODs</b> or a small window with a blue top. 

<br>
With this done , you need to decide on how many detail levels you want to add. I used 8 so ..
create 8 dummies and name them 
<br>
<b>detail145 , detail80 , detail60 , detail30 , detail18 , detail12 , detail6 , and detail3</b> 
<br>
link all 8 detail nodes to Bip01 
<br>
select the MultiRes::bodymesh you made and added a multires modifier to. Select the multires modifier from the stack
and click generate 
<br>
Then , run the adjustLOD script you installed a window will pop up and you will see little buttons representing
the detail nodes you created 
<br>
click each one on , entering these values for each 
<pre>	145 = 1.0 
	80 = .76 
	60 = .64 
	30 = .5 
	18 = .29 
	12 = .13 
	6 = .07 
	3 = .05 
</pre>
These values arent what you have to use they are just what I used for the mesh I made , change them as you see fit 
<br>
click "apply settings" 
<br>
right click on the MultiRes::bodymesh select "properties" Click on the USer Defined tab and you should see these values if you have done it right 
<pre>	MULTIRES::DETAILS = 1.0,0.76,0.64,0.5,0.29,0.13,0.07,0.05 
	MULTIRES::SIZES = 145,80,60,30,18,12,6,3 
</pre>

select those lines and copy them .Now , select your main mesh bodymesh , and right click on it and choose its properties , click on the user defined tab , and if those 2 lines arent there , paste them in . 

now you have a mesh with its LOD levels and all you need are the bounds and nodes for mount , cam etc.. so .. 

<h3>3.) MOUNT NODES , BOUNDING BOXES AND OTHER NODES </h3>

create a box the fully encompasses your character , click on the hierarchy tab on the command panel , select "pivot" and then "affect pivot only" 
move the pivot to the players feet at 0,0,0 and make sure you align the pivot to red arrow RIGHT , Blue Arrow UP and Green FORWARD . Name the box Bounds 
and link it to Bip01. 

In the heirarchy tab , click on "Link Info " and make sure that you uncheck z for move under the inherit heading 
<br>
now , create a Dummy name it Eye . Link it to Bip01 Head , and move the eye node so it is in front of the head , again , make sure Its pivot is set properly 
<br>
{Like the bounds etc..} 
<br>
Create another Dummy and name it " Unlink" , and link it to the Bip01 
<br>
Create another Dummy called " Cam" 
<br>
Make sure its pivot is set right , move it to where the eye node is and link it to the Unlink Dummy 
<br>
Create more Dummys for your Mount nodes name them acordingly ie: mount0 , mount01 etc... and link them to the corresponding Bip parts 

IE: link mount0 to the " Bip01 R Hand " so you cab have a weapon on the right hand etc... 

<br>&nbsp;<br>
now you are about ready to export the character . You just need a cfg file in the directory where you currently open max file resides. 

<h3>4.)THE CFG FILE , KNOW IT , LEARN IT , LOVE IT ! </h3>

I used this in my player.cfg in regards to this demo 
<pre>	AlwaysExport: 
	eye 
	cam 
	mount0 
	mount01 
	Mount02 
	
	NeverExport: 
	Bip01 
	Bip01 L Finger.nub 
	Bip01 R Finger.nub 
	Dummy* 
	Bip01 L Toe.nub 
	Bip01 R Toe.nub 
	start01 
	mountpoint 
	
	
	+Error::AllowEmptySubtrees 
	+Error::AllowCrossedDetails 
	+Error::AllowUnusedMeshes 
	-Error::AllowOldSequences 
	-Error::RequireViconNode 
	-Param::CollapseTransforms 
	
	-Param::findMergeIndices 
	-Param::computeScreenError 
</pre>

you will add and take stuff away as you learn , Ill leave that up to you : )just pass the info on for the rest of us 

<h3>5.) EXPORT ME PLEASE</h3>

OK , now you have a cfg file , multi res and biped , now lets export and test 

select your dts exporter , and open your cfg file . now, under parameters , uncheck Collapse Transforms then export
whole shape to wherever you want to put your new character in the game dir structure . 

OK now it should load into the show tool , but you need to do one more thing before the engine will load it .
With Multi res added , you need to run unmessdts so the game will load it . You do this various ways , heres what I do. 

you place the UnMessdts.exe in the same dir as you new Player.dts you exported . 
creat a new text doc called <b>unmessdts.bat</b> (make sure it has the *.bat extension and not *.txt ).
Right click on the unmessdts.bat and select edit 

add this line 

<pre>	unMessDTS Player.dts Player.dts 
</pre>
and save it . double click unmessdts.bat to run it and you are done . 

<br>&nbsp;<br>
I hope this helps some people out and feel free to add to it or let me know 
what you think . If it gets a good response Ill do one for exporting sequences 
next. If you want to see my max file for this EMAIL ME AT <a href="mailto:jokersgrin@telus.net">jokersgrin@telus.net</a>
or ICQ me at 42499644

<i>have a good one : )</i></td>
